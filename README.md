# BaseApp

Base app is a template for a basic Android project. It has been set up with the tools I use the most in order to avoid time setting up for future projects.  
  
Some of the set up include:

#1) Java 8  
  
#2) Library dependencies:  
a) ButterKnife  
b) RecyclerView  
c) RXJava  
d) Timber  
e) Retro lambda to support lambdas  
  
#3) Basic layout setup including fragments with:  
a) Simple screen navigation  
b) Screen title handler  
c) Toolbar handling  
d) App Theme  
e) Basic strings and dimensions
